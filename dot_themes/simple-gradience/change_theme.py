It might hold the program, at some point...
The idea is to do the following:
- List all available themes and let the user chose one
- Either: create new gtk theme with all the appropriate changes, or edit this one.
  - Editing/new theme means: changing the link to the appropriate css for gtk3/4, editing the gtk2 to match accordingly, creating a qt5 and qt6 color scheme, an xfce4 theme, maybe a kde plasma color scheme, or any other file with a template system (file, color format, location of destination, either locally in this theme, or some other user directory)

This is too complex to program in BASH, so python will be the alternative
